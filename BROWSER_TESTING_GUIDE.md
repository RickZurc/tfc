## Common Issues and Solutions

### Browser Not Found
- Ensure Playwright browsers are installed: `npx playwright install`
- Check system dependencies are installed

### Tests Not Discovered
- Verify Pest configuration includes Browser directory
- Check test file syntax and structure

### Authentication Issues
- Use actual login flow instead of `actingAs()` in browser tests
- Ensure test database has proper user data

### Element Not Found
- Use proper selectors (CSS, data attributes)
- Add wait conditions for dynamic content
- Check for responsive design variations

This comprehensive browser testing suite provides thorough coverage of the TFC application's functionality, ensuring reliability and user experience quality across all major features and user workflows.
